It meant that almost any men, even low attractive ones could get married and have kids.
Breaking this and allowing foids to work has destroyed everything, the birth rate is a complete joke while We have millions of inmigrants who have 5 or more kids in average. 
Foids have started to believe they don't need men so they are much more selective and a lot of men are out of the market. 
Foid rights and affirmative action politics means not only more competition, it means if you are looking for a job and the other candidate is a foid, the company will choose the foid for being a foid. 
Families are not stable anymore and it tendency will be even worse in the new generations, the birth rate will be 0,5 like in South Korea. 
The kikes and the kike ruled governments know that they can destroy us just letting some millions of inmigrants be here, we are to soy to avoid this.
