She was wearing this crop top with her whole belly showing and booty shorts that showed half the cheeks. How does she get away with this? She doesn't even wear the uniform.

She was on register 4 and I was on 3 and she was on her phone alot and I was just staring at her half covered ass the entire time. I didn't wanna creepshot because idk how old she is but just from looking at oh my god I was about to bust and I didn't even jack off. You know how your dick has a muscle and you can move it? I was doing that hands free and when she move and her ass jiggled, I busted right there and let out a moan fuuck and she look at me and I ran away to the bathroom to clean off my nut.

Im gonna have to wake up early now to bust so I don't get so horny at work. The next day I wanted to introduce myself to her and I was like hey what's up and shes normally talkative to the other coworkers but she gave me one word answers and her voice yea I knew she didn't like me

This is literally torture, she wore that outfit twice and it doesn't look like she's gonna stop, what am I supposed to do keep busting in my pants looking at her? I think the boss likes it that's why she allowed to wear it but why does she like wearing it at all?

It meant that almost any men, even low attractive ones could get married and have kids.
Breaking this and allowing foids to work has destroyed everything, the birth rate is a complete joke while We have millions of inmigrants who have 5 or more kids in average. 
Foids have started to believe they don't need men so they are much more selective and a lot of men are out of the market. 
Foid rights and affirmative action politics means not only more competition, it means if you are looking for a job and the other candidate is a foid, the company will choose the foid for being a foid. 
Families are not stable anymore and it tendency will be even worse in the new generations, the birth rate will be 0,5 like in South Korea. 
The kikes and the kike ruled governments know that they can destroy us just letting some millions of inmigrants be here, we are to soy to avoid this.
